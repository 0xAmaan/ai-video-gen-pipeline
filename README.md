# AI Video Gen Pipeline

AI Video Generation Pipeline is a modern web application built with Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript that enables users to create AI-generated videos through an intuitive multi-phase workflow. The application features a four-stage pipeline (Input, Storyboard, Generation, and Editor) where users can specify their video requirements including prompt, target audience, tone, duration, and style, then review AI-generated storyboards before final video generation. Built with Convex for real-time data management, Clerk for authentication, and Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components for a polished user interface, the platform provides a seamless experience from concept to final video export with built-in editing capabilities.
