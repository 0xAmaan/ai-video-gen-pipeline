Current editor has basic functionality. Need to enhance to match CapCut-like experience with professional editing capabilities.

Tech stack: Using Conva for editing interface, Media Bunny for video exporting

Features to add:

Transition effects and filters (leverage open source libraries)

Speed controls for ramp up/down effects within clips

AI-generated text overlays with customizable positioning

Grain, filters, and visual effects beyond base video generation

Regeneration capability for individual clips within editor

Transition library and effect presets for non-technical users

Success criteria:

Editor feels as intuitive as CapCut

Users can apply transitions without technical knowledge

Speed ramping works smoothly for ad-style pacing

Text overlays integrate seamlessly with AI-generated content
